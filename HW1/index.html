                <p>Nostalgia is what fueled the design of this web page.</p>
                <p> I incorperated some nostalgic elements from my past because
                     some of these things have shaped who I am today.</p>
                <p>I wanted the color scheme to be playful while also emitting a dream-like atmosphere. Purples and pinks
                    are often associated with these feelings, according to science.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Maria Goman and I'm currently a student at the
                     University of Montana majoring in Media Arts.</p>
                <p>I've always been creative and artistic. Ever since I could remember, I was drawing, painting--whatever I could get my hands on. 
                    I'm taking this major to utilize my creative abilties. 
                <p>I'm leaning towards the graphic design route as an outlet to portray my skills. I've
                     already helped make logos for businesses of friends, family, and colleagues.
                     It brings me a lot of joy that I feel like I'm helping other people with my skills.</p>
                <p>I'm also pursuing a website certificate, because I've taken an interest in website design upon taking this degree.
                    I'm not the greatest at it, because coding is a little challenging for me. I've never been the mathematical or linear thinking type
                    but I'm still determined to improve my knowledge and understanding of website developement and design. My goal for this semester
                    is to get to a point to where I can be comfortable making websites, and actually implement those skills to make websites for real-life people.</p>

            <h1>Fun Facts About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm a hobby baker and I run a small cottage bakery from my home. I listen to heavy metal music when I'm stressed and I also love to watch Korean dramas.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite memories of me playing a game is playing Mario Kart with my sister. We used to play it all night long during summer vacations
                    in grade school. We'd have the windows open for fresh air while eating snacks, listening to music, and chatting about life. These are some of my most
                    fond memories growing up, and it still brings a smile to my face whenever I think about it. That is why the theme is loosely inspired by
                    my nostalgic memories of playing Mario Kart.
