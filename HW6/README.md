For this assignment, I mainly relied on Google and referred back to the example homework. I wanted to try understanding the structure on my own first before getting additional help from A.I. The part that confused me the most was using math functions and loops together. I understood the idea of randomizing images conceptually, but actually writing the Math.random() logic and combining it with loops felt overwhelming at first. I had to think carefully about how the loop was running and how many times each image should be added to the array. It took some trial and error before it made sense.

Another issue I had was that my images were not showing up at all. That was frustrating because I thought my logic was correct. After troubleshooting, I realized the problem was not the code itself but the file structure. My main.js file was not placed inside the correct scripts folder. Once I fixed the file path, everything started working. That experience taught me that sometimes errors are not about logic, but about organization and hierarchy. Small structural details in coding matter a lot. Files need to be in the correct location, and functions must be called at the right time.

After completing the assignment, I then used AI to compare. I noticed that there are multiple ways to solve the same problem. However, building most of it on my own helped me understand the logic more deeply.
