To be honest, this assignment was a bit tricky for me. I've looked up many tutorials to follow on how to create a choose-your-own-adventure, but none of them functioned correctly or gave me the results I wanted. I tried to make the story without any buttons because I thought it was going to be easier, but then I had a very hard time aligning the text. Then I decided to add buttons with the choices and put them inside a div container because I found it easier to control the alignment. However, including the buttons came with it's own set of challenges. I ended up using ChatGPT to help me configure javascript codes that handles both the functions of the buttons and the choices together, but it's still not working right. When you click on either of the first three choices (left, middle, right), the text doesn't change on the buttons for the next choice, even though I included the commands. It's not showing anything except for "left" or "middle path", and I don't know what I did wrong or how to fix it. One thing I am pleased with is the design choices I made. It looks organized with a balanced alignment of the elements (the header, div container, buttons). I added a very pale green background to make the pink buttons stand out because green is a complementary color to pink. I also wanted to include images that represented each player's newfound powers, but once again had difficulty including them inside the javascript text. It messed up the functionality of the buttons and I kept getting many error messages. I decided to just leave my assignment as is for know. It's not what I had planned, but for now it's somewhat functional.
