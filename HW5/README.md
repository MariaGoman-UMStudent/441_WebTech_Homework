I had ChatGPT make their own alternate version of the assignment and I think their version was pretty similar to mine, especially using a storyline with a forest and multiple pathways. The javascript coding in the ChatGPT version was also more simplified and organized than mine. The biggest difference between both versions was that I used more complex math functions, loops, and switch statements, which worked better for my story line. ChatGPT did not include any switch statements in their version, since that specification was optional. Also, ChatGPT put their CSS coding within the body of the index page, while I put my CSS style choices in a seperate document linked to the index page. Overall, I think it's pretty neat how the coding is relatively similar to each other. It gives me a sense of confirmation and validation that I'm doing something right.
