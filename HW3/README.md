The final version still felt like my own work. Honestly, my work wasn't that much different than the AI version, which surprised me a little bit. The only difference was that the AI version was a little more polished and used correct syntax. I only had one console log syntax error. I'm not surprised that AI curated the perfect code without any error. However, I feel like we shouldn't rely solely on AI generated work for everything when it comes to web development. We should use some of our own inputs and ideas and use AI as a tool on an as needed basis. I was a little worried that the AI version was going to be completely different than mine, but I must be doing something right if both versions are very similar. I feel very relieved by that because Javascript is intimidating to me.
